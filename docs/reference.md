This is the full documentation for geospaNN package, the functions are devided into three Modules.

1. Module [utils](utils.md) contains most of the utility function used to build the package. Most of the functions works around NNGP approximation to accerte the computation.
2. Module [model](model.md) contains model class for NN-GLS as well as normal Neural Networks. Also, graph convolution architectures are defined in this module.
3. Module [main](main.md) contains major wrappers for the training process.
